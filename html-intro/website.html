  <!--To Create a paragraph text-->
<p>A good paragraph has a topic sentence, supporting details, and a conclusion. 
    The topic sentence states the main point of the paragraph, and the rest of the paragraph should relate to it.
     The supporting details, or development sentences, elaborate on the topic with more detail. 
     The conclusion sentence summarizes the topic or provides one final piece of support.</p>
